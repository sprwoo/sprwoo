I'm Daniel Yang, or just Yang or Woo or Daniel or whatever.

I am (planning to be) a **pure mathematics** and **combinatorics/optimization** student at the **University of Waterloo**.

Currently, I am working on:
- getting cooked 

When I am not doing any of these things, I am either stressing over math, playing Lash in Deadlock, or dreading over my inability to get a job. 

Feel free to contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangiel/).
