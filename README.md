I'm Daniel Yang, or what I would prefer to go by in the sea of Daniel Yangs, **Woo**.

I am (planning to be) a **pure mathematics** and **combinatorics/optimization** student at the **University of Waterloo**. I want to learn as much as I can to truly understand the mathematics behind computer science.

Currently, I am working on:
- Interning at the APILab at the University of Western
- An OpenAI wrapper for research papers (I hate making wrappers)
- A CV thing (if fahmi gets back to me about it)

When I am not doing any of these things, I am either stressing over math, grinding [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/sprucetreeleaf/), learning Tekken combos, or dreading over my inability to get a job.
